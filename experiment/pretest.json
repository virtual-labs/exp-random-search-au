      "question": "In Random Search, what happens if the algorithm reaches a dead-end?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It backtracks systematically to the previous node.",
        "b": "It chooses another path randomly from the start or remaining unexplored nodes.",
        "c": "It terminates immediately without finding the goal.",

      "question": "Why is Random Search often considered as a baseline algorithm?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it is the fastest algorithm for graph traversal.",
        "b": "Because it ensures the most optimal path.",
        "c": "Because it is simple and can be compared against advanced methods.",
        "d": "Because it requires heuristics to work."

        "a": "It is too complex to implement.",
        "b": "It cannot be applied to optimization problems.",
        "c": "It may fail to find the goal or return a non-optimal path.",
