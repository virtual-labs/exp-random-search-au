      "question": "Suppose Random Search is applied to find a path from A to D. If the random choices are A → B → E (dead-end), what is the algorithm likely to do next?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Stop immediately and report failure.",
        "b": "Backtrack systematically like DFS.",
        "c": "Randomly restart or choose another unexplored path.",

    {
      "question": "Why does Random Search not guarantee success in graph traversal?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it does not use heuristics or structured exploration.",
        "b": "Because it explores all possible paths before stopping.",
        "c": "Because it requires a cost function to work.",
        "d": "Because it is slower than BFS or DFS."

      "question": "In optimization problems, Random Search is useful when:",

        "a": "The search space is small and deterministic.",
        "b": "The search space is large, and systematic exploration is infeasible.",

        "b": "Producing different paths on different runs, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding.",
