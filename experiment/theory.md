### Theory

## Create the Graph and set the search parameters:
    Select whether directed /undirected graph
    Select creating graph manual/random
    Enter Source Node and Destination Node
    Initiate Search on Graph
## Generate solution:
    Visualize the steps / data structure to store the intermediate values.
    Visualize the path from selecting a starting point on the graph and then following a random path through the graph until the destination is not reached.
    Iterations can be animated; paths can be highlighted.
    The result will be a path which displays the end of the search.
